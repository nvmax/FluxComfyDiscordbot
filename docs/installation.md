## üì¶ Required Files

   - Flux Dev requires you to approve the license agreement on huggingface before the setup tool can download the models, please do this before running the setup tool.
   - Click on links below and apply for access to files, no need to download them, they will be automatically downloaded with setup tool, just needs access.
   - [Flux AE.Safetensors](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev/resolve/main/ae.safetensors)

   - [Flux1.dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev ) 
   
   - [Flux.1-Redux-dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Redux-dev/tree/main)
   - [sigclip_vision_384](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/sigclip_vision_384/blob/main/sigclip_vision_patch14_384.safetensors) 

   - Pulid should be downloaded automatically no need to open a repo
   - when installing missing nodes for pulid, make sure you select the correct version
    - ComfyUI-PuLID-Flux-Enhanced (node 1518) (DO NOT INSTALL any other versions)

## üîß Installation Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ ComfyUI Setup
1. Ensure ComfyUI is properly installed
2. Verify your installation directory structure:
   ```
   Example: 
   C:/Comfyui_windows_portable/ComfyUI/
   ```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Bot Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nvmax/FluxComfyDiscordbot
   ```
2.  Launch Comfyui and load workflow.json from required_files and install missing nodes, do the same for redux.json, reduxprompt.json and Pulid24GB.json.
  - note when installing missing nodes for pulid, make sure you select the correct version - ComfyUI-PuLID-Flux-Enhanced (node 1518) (DO NOT INSTALL any other versions)

3. Install the required dependencies using the requirements.txt file: 
 ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

4. **Run Setup Tool**
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```
   The setup tool will:
   - Copy required files needed to run
   - Setup your .env file with variables specified
   - download all files from huggingface and place them in the required folders
   

5. To get Redux working properly you will need to open Redux.json and Reduxprompt.json and install the missing nodes.
   - depending on your setup you may need to edit the json files to select the version of dev flux you are using. 
- you can open these in comfyui and change the checkpoint in the gui, then click workflow and export api and replace the redux.json and reduxprompt.json files with the new json files. !!! DO NOT CHANGE THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORKFLOWS IN COMFYUI !!!
- manually editing them open the .json files and change the name of the unet_name to the name of the checkpoint you want to use, the checkpoint you use must be in the models/unet folder.

   - In redux.json find and change the name to your checkpoint name.
``` 
      "61": {
    "inputs": {
      "unet_name": "fluxFusionV24StepsGGUFNF4_V2Fp16.safetensors",
      "weight_dtype": "fp8_e4m3fn"
    },
    "class_type": "UNETLoader"
  },
```  
   - in reduxprompt.json find and change the name to your checkpoint name.
```
 "12": {
    "inputs": {
      "unet_name": "fluxFusionV24StepsGGUFNF4_V2Fp16.safetensors",
      "weight_dtype": "fp8_e4m3fn"
    },
    "class_type": "UNETLoader"
  },
```
- here are the names of the checkpoints for each version of Flux that can be used in the json files.
```
'FLUXFusion 6GB': 
        'filename': 'fluxFusionV24StepsGGUFNF4_V2GGUFQ3KM.gguf',

    'FLUXFusion 8GB': 
        'filename': 'fluxFusionV24StepsGGUFNF4_V2GGUFQ50.gguf',
        
    'FLUXFusion 10GB': 
        'filename': 'fluxFusionV24StepsGGUFNF4_V2GGUFQ6K.gguf',
        

    'FLUXFusion 12GB': 
        'filename': 'fluxFusionV24StepsGGUFNF4_V2GGUFQ80.gguf',

    'FLUXFusion 24GB': 
        'filename': 'fluxFusionV24StepsGGUFNF4_V2Fp16.safetensors',

    'FLUX.1 Dev': 
        'filename': 'flux1-dev.safetensors',

    
```
- Please enter in the one you specified when you run the setup.py so your not constantly switching checkpoints and causing slow downs.

- I am working on automating this process so you don't have to do it manually.

### Common Issues
- Check [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting.md) for common problems
- Verify file permissions
- Confirm Python version compatibility
- Cant get Pulid working?, it wont install ( lots of people have this problem), seems like its not straight foward to get it working, I have even had issues luckily I have a solution, here is a complete comfyui clone with pulid and all nodes insalled, it has all nodes installed and pulid working, no models no loras, so you must still run the setup tool.
